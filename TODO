1. It might be nice to allow something like this:

	method $foo ($self: Int $x) {
		...;
	}
	
	$self->$foo(1234);

2. Would be good to allow:

	# This would localize the package variable
	# 
	method dump ($self: Int $Data::Dumper::MadDepth = 1) {
		return Data::Dumper::Dumper($self);
	}

3. Also:

	# Again, this would localize the package variable
	# 
	method bar ($self: Int our $quux = 42) {
		...;
	}
	
4. And:

	# "my" is the default anyway...
	# 
	method baz ($self: Int my $quux = 42) {
		...;
	}
