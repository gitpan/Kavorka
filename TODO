1. It might be nice to allow something like this:

	method $foo ($self: Int $x) {
		...;
	}
	
	$self->$foo(1234);

2. Maybe attempt to get Perl 6 style attributive parameters working:

	method foo ($self: $.name) {
		# $.name is an alias (tied) for $self->name attribute
		# only works if you have a meta object (i.e. Moose/Mouse)
	}

This may be of limited utility.

See http://perlcabal.org/syn/S06.html#Attributive_parameters

3. Optimizations for multi subs and multi methods.

4. Documentation:

	- document ||= defaults
