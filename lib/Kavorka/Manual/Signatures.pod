=head1 NAME

Kavorka::Manual::Signatures - experience the lure of the animal

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The signature consists of a list of parameters for the function.

Each parameter is a variable name which will be available within the
body of the function. Variable names are assumed to be lexicals unless
they look like punctuation variables or escape-character global
variables, in which case they'll be implicitly localized within the
function.

Parameters are separated with commas, however if one of the commas
is replaced by a colon, all parameters to the left are assumed to be
invocants and are shifted off C<< @_ >>. If no invocants are explicitly
listed as part of the signature, the module implementing the keyword
may assume a default invocant - for example, C<method> assumes an
invocant called C<< $self >> while C<around> assumes two invocants
called C<< ${^NEXT} >> and C<< $self >>.

=head2 Positional parameters

Parameters which are not explicitly named, slurpy or invocants, are
positional. For example:

   method foo ( $x, $y ) { ... }

Is roughly equivalent to:

   sub foo {
      my $self = shift;
      die "Expected two parameters" unless @_ == 2;
      my ($x, $y) = @_;
      ...
   }

This feature is shared with Perl 6 signatures, L<Function::Parameters>,
and L<Method::Signatures>.

=head2 Invocants

Invocants are a type of positional parameter, which instead of being
copied from the C<< @_ >> array are shifted off it.

Invocants are always required, and cannot have defaults. Some keywords
(such as C<< method >> and C<< classmethod >>) provide a standard
invocant for you (respectively C<< $self >> and C<< $class >>).

You may specify invocants in the signature manually, in which case the
default provided by the keyword is ignored.

   # The invocant is called $me instead of $self
   method ($me: $x, $y?) { ... }

This feature is shared with Perl 6 signatures, L<Function::Parameters>,
and L<Method::Signatures>. Unique to Kavorka is the ability to specify
multiple invocants.

=head2 Named parameters

Parameters can be named by preceding them with a colon:

   method foo ( :$x, :$y ) { ... }

The method would be called like this:

   $object->foo( x => 1, y => 2 );

This feature is shared with Perl 6 signatures, L<Function::Parameters>,
and L<Method::Signatures>.

Positional parameters (if any) must precede named parameters.

If you have any named parameters, they will also be made available in
the magic global hash C<< %_ >>.

=head2 Long name parameters

Named parameters can be given a different name "inside" and "outside"
the function:

   fun bar ( :public_house($pub) ) { ... }

The function would be called like this:

   bar( public_house => "Rose & Crown" );

... But within the function, the variable would be named C<< $pub >>.

This feature is shared with Perl 6 signatures.

Long named parameters will be available in C<< %_ >> under their
"outside" name, not their "inside" name.

A function can have multiple long names:

   fun xxx ( :foo(:bar(:baz($x))) ) { ... }

This unwieldy syntax is borrowed from Perl 6 signatures.

Kavorka provides an experimental shortcut - you may omit the
parentheses:

   fun xxx ( :foo :bar :baz $x ) { ... }

=head2 Global variables

The variables established by Kavorka are normally plain old lexicals
(C<my> variables). However, you can instead make them into localised
package variables (C<our> variables):

   fun xxx ( Int our $x ) { ... }

Variables containing "::", the special globals C<< $_ >>, C<< @_ >>,
and C<< %_ >>, and variables named like C<< ${^HELLO} >> are
automatically localized.

(The other special punctuation variables listed in L<perlvar> are not
supported.)

=head2 Optional and required parameters

A trailing exclamation mark makes an attribute required. A trailing
question mark makes an attribute optional.

This feature is shared with Perl 6 signatures and L<Method::Signatures>.

In the absence of explicit indicators, positional parameters will be
required unless a default is provided for them, and named parameters
will be optional.

You can not use named parameters and optional positional parameters in
the same signature.

For long named parameters, the trailing indicator should appear
after the close parentheses:

   fun xxx ( :foo($x)! ) { ... }
   fun xxx ( :foo($x!) ) { ... }   # NO!

=head2 Slurpy parameters

The final parameter in the signature may be an array or hash, which
will consume all remaining arguments:

   fun foo ( $x, $y, %z ) { ... }
   
   foo(1..4);  # %z is (3 => 4)

This feature is shared with Perl 6 signatures, L<Function::Parameters>,
and L<Method::Signatures>.

A slurpy array may not be used if the signature contains any named
parameters.

Unique to Kavorka is the ability to specify slurpy arrayrefs or
hashrefs.

   fun foo ( $x, $y, slurpy HashRef $z ) { ... }
   
   foo(1..4);  # $z is { 3 => 4 }

For slurpy references you should specify a type constraint (see
L</Type Constraints>) so that Kavorka can create the correct type of
reference.

The variables C<< @_ >> and C<< %_ >> I<< may >> be used as slurpy
parameters, I<< but only if their use as a parameter does not interfere
with their usual meaning >>.

   # ok
   fun foo ( @_ ) {
      ...;
   }
   
   # disallowed because the @_ array would usually include $x
   fun bar ( $x, @_ ) {
      ...;
   }
   
   # ok because the invocant $x would usually be shifted off @_
   fun baz ( $x: @_ ) {
      ...;
   }

=head2 Type constraints

Type constraints may be specified for each parameter in the signature:

   fun foo ( Int $x, HTTP::Tiny $y ) { ... }

This feature is shared with Perl 6 signatures, L<Function::Parameters>,
and L<Method::Signatures>.

Type constraints are parsed as per C<dwim_type> from L<Type::Utils>,
which should mostly do what you mean.

Type constraints for slurpy hashes and arrays are applied to each value
in the hash or each item in the array. Type constraints for slurpy
references are instead applied to the reference as a whole. Therefore
the following are roughly equivalent:

   fun foo ( Str %z ) { my $z = \%z; ... }
   fun foo ( slurpy HashRef[Str] $z ) { ... }

Type constraints may be surrounded with parentheses, in which case,
instead of parsing them with C<dwim_type>, they'll be evaluated (at
compile time) as an expression which is expected to return a blessed
L<Type::Tiny> object:

   use Types::Standard qw( LaxNum StrictNum );
   
   fun foo ( ($ENV{AUTOMATED_TESTING} ? StrictNum : LaxNum) $x ) {
      ...;
   }

This feature is shared with L<Function::Parameters>.

=head2 Value constraints

Value constraints can be used to further constrain values. Value
constraints are specified using the C<where> keyword followed by a
block.

   fun foo ( Int $even where { $_ % 2 == 0 } )

Multiple C<where> blocks may be provided:

   fun foo ( Int $even where { $_ % 2 == 0 } where { $_ > 0 } )

This feature is shared with Perl 6 signatures and L<Method::Signatures>.

The non-block form of C<where> supported by L<Method::Signatures> is
not supported by Kavorka, but can be emulated using L<match::simple>:

   # Method::Signatures allows this (performing smart match):
   #
   method foo ( Int $x where $y ) {
      ...
   }
   
   # For Kavorka, try this:
   #
   method foo ( Int $x where { match($_, $y) } ) {
      ...
   }

=head2 Defaults

Defaults may be provided using an equals sign:

   fun foo ( $greeting = "Hello world" ) {
      ...
   }

This feature is shared with Perl 6 signatures, L<Function::Parameters>,
and L<Method::Signatures>.

Kavorka will use the default if the argument is not given when the
function is invoked. If an explicit undef is passed to the function
when it is called, this is accepted as the value for the parameter, and
the default is not used.

If instead you want the default to take effect when an explicit undef
is passed to the function, use C<< //= >>:

   fun foo ( $greeting //= "Hello world" ) {
      ...
   }

This feature is shared with L<Method::Signatures>. Kavorka doesn't
support Method::Signatures' C<when> keyword.

C<< ||= >> is also supported for setting defaults. It kicks in when any
false value (undef, zero, the empty string, or objects overloading
boolification to return false) is passed to the function, though this
is rarely of much use.

Slurpy parameters may take defaults:

   fun foo ( @bar = (1, 2, 3) ) { ... }

For slurpy references, the syntax is a little unintuitive:

   fun foo ( slurpy ArrayRef $bar = (1, 2, 3) ) { ... }

=head2 Traits

Traits may be added to each parameter using the C<is> keyword:

   fun foo ( $greeting is polite = "Hello world" ) { ... }
   
   fun bar ( $baz is quux is xyzzy ) { ... }

The keyword C<does> is also available which acts as an alias for C<is>.

This feature is shared with Perl 6 signatures and L<Method::Signatures>.

You can use pretty much any word you like as a trait; Kavorka doesn't
check that they're "valid" or anything. Choosing random words of course
won't do anything, but the traits are available through the
introspection API.

The traits Kavorka understands natively are:

=head3 alias

This makes your lexical variable into an alias for an item within
the C<< @_ >> array.

   fun increment (Int $i) { ++$i }
   
   my $count = 0;
   increment($count);
   increment($count);
   increment($count);
   say $count;          # says 3

But please don't use this for parameters with coercions!

This feature is shared with L<Method::Signatures>.

=head3 coerce

See L</Type coercion> below.

=head3 copy

This is the opposite of alias, and is the default. It makes the lexical
variable a (very shallow) copy of the argument from C<< @_ >>. That is,
it's equivalent to doing:

   my $param = $_[$i];
   
   # whereas the `alias` trait does this...
   Data::Alias::alias(my $param = $_[$i]);

=head3 locked

This locks hash(ref) keys - see L<Hash::Util>. For references
this trait has the unfortunate side-effect of leaving the hashref
locked I<outside> the function too!

This trait has special support for the C<Dict> type constraint from
L<Types::Standard>, including optional keys in the list of allowed
keys.

   fun foo (HashRef $x is locked) {
      $x->{foo} = 1;
   }
   
   my $var1 = { foo => 42 };
   foo($var1);
   say $var1->{foo};           # says 1
   
   my $var2 = { bar => 42 };
   foo($var2);                 # dies

=head3 optional

The C<?> and C<!> syntax is just a shortcut for applying or not
applying this trait.

   fun foo ($x is optional) { ... }            # These two declarations
   fun foo ($x?) { ... }                       # are equivalent.

=head3 ro

This makes the parameter a (shallow) read-only variable.

   fun foo ($x is ro) { $x++ }
   
   foo(42);   # dies

This feature is shared with Perl 6 signatures.

=head3 rw

This is the default, so is a no-op, but if you have a mixture
of read-only and read-write variables, it may aid clarity to explicitly
add C<is rw> to the read-write ones.

=head3 slurpy

The slurpy prefix to the type constraint is just a shortcut for a
trait.

   fun foo ( ArrayRef $bar is slurpy ) { ... } # These two declarations
   fun foo ( slurpy ArrayRef $bar ) { ... }    # are equivalant

=head2 Type coercion

Coercion can be enabled for a parameter using the C<coerce> trait.

   use Types::Path::Tiny qw(AbsPath);
   
   method print_to_file ( AbsFile $file does coerce, @lines ) {
      $file->spew(@lines);
   }

This feature is shared with L<Method::Signatures>.

=head2 The Yada Yada

Normally passing additional parameters to a function declared with a
signature will throw an exception:

   fun foo ($x) {
      return $x;
   }
   
   foo(1, 2);    # error - too many arguments

Adding the yada yada operator to the end of the signature allows the
function to accept extra trailing parameters:

   fun foo ($x, ...) {
      return $x;
   }
   
   foo(1, 2);    # ok

This feature is shared with L<Method::Signatures>.
